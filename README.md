      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p><strong>MulticutGame</strong> is a mobile puzzle game inspired by the Minimal-Cost-Multicut Problem.</p>
      <p>Developed for <strong>Android</strong> and <strong>iOS</strong> using <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>.</p>
      <p>The player cuts edges with their finger. Each edge has a cost, and the goal is to minimize the total cost of all cuts.</p>
      <p>However, there's a twist: a cut must not separate nodes that belong to the same connected component.</p>
